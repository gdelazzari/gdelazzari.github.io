Hi everyone, I'm an 18 years old italian IT student and this is my blog.

I like playing with software, electronics, microcontrollers (**a lot!**),
robotics, neural networks and a lot of other stuff. I also like photography and
design.

Here you will find a little diary of my projects, daily adventures and various
things I have in my mind.
You can also checkout [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/gdelazzari/) to see
what I am working on.

Thanks for the time you're taking to read this!
